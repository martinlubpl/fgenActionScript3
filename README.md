## Info

The repository is an archive of the old version of the fotogen.ch website. This page was made by me in Adobe Flash technology, using Actionscript3 (object oriented language of flash). The current version is developed using bootstrap and jquery, I'm no longer a programmer of this site. Since my version of the site is no longer present on the web, I decided to publish this repository and present screenshots (see below).

The main part of the code is the [/src/main.as](/src/main.as) file (over 2000 lines of Actionscript code).

The other part of the project, also made by me, was the admin panel (php + mysql technology). You can browse it in the [/admin/](/admin/)  directory (over 3000 lines of php code)
